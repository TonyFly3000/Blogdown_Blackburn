# Introduction to APIs in Google
The *GET* request method is used by a client to fetch data from a server. If the requested resource is found on the server, it will then be sent back to the client.


The *PUT* method replaces existing data or creates data if it does not exist. If you use PUT many times, it will have no effect â€” there will only be one copy of the dataset on the server.


The *POST* method is used primarily to create new resources. Using POST many times will add data in multiple places on the server. It is recommended to use PUT to update resources and POST to create new resources.

The *DELETE* method will remove data or resources specified by the client on a server.


RESTful APIs use either XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as file formats for data held in the body of an HTTP request method.



JSON example
{
	"Name": "Julie",
	"Hometown": "Los Angeles, CA",
	"Age": 28
	"food":["apple:,"fish"]
}
