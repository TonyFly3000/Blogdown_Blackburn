The project was conceived in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000. S : is a statistical programming language developed primarily by John Chambers at Bell Laboratories in 1975. Python: is created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.Python 3.0 was released on 2008. SQL: Structured Query Language[SQL] was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in 1970. MATLAB: Cleve Moler, the chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico, started developing MATLAB in the late 1970. SAS: The development of SAS began in 1966 at North Carolina State University by Anthony Barr and his student James Goodnight(current CEO of SAS). library(plotly) google_trend&lt;- read.csv(&quot;./data/multiTimeline001.csv&quot;, header=TRUE,skip=1) p &lt;- plot_ly(google_trend, x = ~Week, y = ~R...Worldwide.,name = &#39;R&#39;, type = &#39;scatter&#39;, mode = &#39;lines&#39;)%&gt;% add_trace(y = ~SQL...Worldwide., name = &#39;SQL&#39;, mode = &#39;lines&#39;)%&gt;% add_trace(y = ~Python...Worldwide., name = &#39;Python&#39;, mode = &#39;lines&#39;)%&gt;% layout(title = &quot;Past 5 years Google Trends&quot;, xaxis = list(title = &quot;Date&quot;), yaxis = list (title = &quot;Interest&quot;)) p 1.2 Install R and RStudio R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.Download R at CRAN:www.r-project.org CRAN stand for The Comprehensive R Archive Network. It is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. CRAN is maintained by the efforts of volunteers (the ‘CRAN team’).That is a group of talent who contribute their time and expertise to make better Package RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

Untill Aug 2017, the CRAN package repository features 11288 available packages. R language itself is just the glue,thandsands of usefully packages from the world is the key to make the great R ecosystem.Each package consist of method,function and data to tackle a specific problem. In order to use a package.we need to first download it and then load the package. 1.5.1 Install a package from CRAN: install.packages(&#39;ggplot2&#39;) load a package: libray(ggplot2) Package on CRAN are been verified and tested by CRAN Team. Be careful when you need to download Package from other sources. 1.5.2 Install a package from Github(NOT recommended): install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) library(devtools) devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) 1.5.3 Install a package from Github zip file (NOT recommended): # unzio zip file unzip(&quot;mongolite-master.zip&quot;) # rename file.rename(&quot;mongolite-master&quot;, &quot;mongolite&quot;) # build tar.gz file shell(&quot;R CMD build mongolite&quot;) # install package from tar.gz file install.packages(&quot;mongolite_2.0.tar.gz&quot;, repos = NULL) library(mongolite) 1.5.4 Get help on Package: question mark follow by package name ?ggplot2 1.5.5 Uninstall packages: library(installr) uninstall.packages(c(&quot;reshape&quot;,&#39;plyr&#39;)) 1.5.6 Check R installed packages location: .libPaths() ## [1] &quot;C:/Users/User/Documents/R/win-library/3.5&quot; ## [2] &quot;C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.1/library&quot; Popluar Package: ggplot2:ggplot2 is a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics. dplyr:dplyr provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges. tidyr:tidyr provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. readr:readr provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf). tibble:tibble is a modern re-imaginging of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what it has not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly. readxl:The readxl package makes it easy to get data out of Excel and into R. "]
